# MCP Server for Python
As of October 2025, MCP Servers are all the rage. This made me, like most people, curious about how this new AI integration breakthrough works. 
To that end, I consulted the documentation at: 

> https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro

to make one of my own.
This very simple MCP Server is designed to help users discuss Pokémon moves.
It isn't expected to be a very well-put-together server, but is intended as a learning experience to have fun and learn a bit about MCP.
That said, I want you, the reader, to know what you may do with this MCP server, in case you want to learn with it, take some ideas, or expand its functionality.

My MCP server features one tool: Get_moves:

With it, you can ask Claude or your AI assistant that supports MCP any questions about Pokémon moves.

For instance, you can ask your AI assistant what moves a given Pokémon has:

You may also ask it if a Pokémon has a specific move:

You can even ask:

As you can see, it is rather impressive how little context and coding you need to provide for such a comprehensive response from Claude. 
I'll probably add more tools to the server, but for now it will remain as is.
